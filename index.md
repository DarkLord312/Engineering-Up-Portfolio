# LED Light-Up Sneakers
LED Light-Up Sneakers I can light them up to different colors and even make them lights to have animation by codes! I use Arduino to code my LED strip light. can't wait to make one for my skateboard.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

# Second Milestone 

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to light up my LED strip light with Arduino, and then, be able to code using Arduino IDE to make my LED light and have animation within itself. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller, Breadboard, and LED are and how the code works.
