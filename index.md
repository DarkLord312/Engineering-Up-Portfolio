# LED Light-Up Sneakers
With my LED Light-Up Sneakers, I can light them up to different colors and even animate the lights all by codes! I use the Arduino IDE to code my LED strip light. I can't wait to make a light-up skateboard from the knowledge I learned in this program. After the Engineering Up program and graduating from high school, I will continue my studies in Computer science and Business, where one day I will have my own business and make a community where we all work toward shared goals.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I have learned how to use soldering and connect wires with Solder. Solder is a metal that has a low melting point which causes it to melt and freeze fast. All along I have also learned how to use FTDI to program a pro mini Arduino which a pro mini Arduino can not directly get connected to the computer to save the codes within itself. I have applied adjustments to the codes to make them look like fire ðŸ”¥.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to light up my LED strip light with Arduino, and then, be able to code using Arduino IDE to make my LED light and have animation within itself. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller, Breadboard, and LED are and how the code works.
